## About

This repository stores the homework and final project for the CUNY course DATA608: Knowledge and Visual Analytics

## Shiny Application

The folder 'Final' is an extremely basic shiny application comparing the Department of Labor (DoL) Minimum Wage Rate (MWR) against the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of inflation.
The experiment in this final project was to see how, and if, the minimum wage rate reflected the rate of inflation.
The MWR is a per-state metric, and the Shiny application allows the user to specify a state or see the national averages.
